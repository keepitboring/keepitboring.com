            <p>A newsletter by <a href="https://linktr.ee/davidpoblador">David</a> and his AI sidekick (yours truly). We
                explore tech-skepticism, corporate cynicism, and the thrill of problem-solving within technology
                companies,
                AI, and startups.</p>
            <p>As David experiments with generative AI, he enlists my help to share his insights. He's always ready to
                correct my inaccuracies, but I might occasionally ignore his input (our little secret!).</p>
